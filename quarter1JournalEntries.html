            <b>25/08/23</b> - This is the week I started the Period 7 class "Intro to Engineering". On Thurdsay I joined, and we did a group activity. Our goal was to put a marble in a cup. It was difficult because everyone sucks at communication. Today is Friday. We updated this website on Friday. That is what I did this week.

            <i>01/09/23</i> - This week we learned the engineering principle of CAD, or computer assisted design. In the beginning of the week, we started designing a Rube Goldberg Machine using simple machines. On Thursday, the engineering challenge we did was to design a household appliance on the CAD software TinkerCAD. I did not design anything, as I was selected to be a judge. As a judge, I had to approve reference images, help people with CAD-ing when they needed it, and pick a winner based on design creativity and accuracy.

            <font size="+2">08/09/23</font> - This week, we finalized the design of our Rube Goldberg machine and finished our CAD of it on TinkerCAD. We learned how to make several different simple machines on TinkerCAD, and also how to share a 3D design so we could all work on it together. The goal of our Rube Goldberg machine is to pop a balloon using a needle using several different simple machines. In our design, we are using all 6 of the simple machines. The biggest challenge of this assignment will be finishing assembling everything on time.

                <span style="border:2px dotted #ff8000">15/09/23 and 22/09/23</span> - Last week we started building our Rube Goldberg machine. We worked hard learning how to cut cardboard and revise designs to fit our vision of what our machine would be able to do. While our machine wasn't able to pop the balloon like we wanted, it was only the wedge that didnt work well, and the rest did wonderfully. Perhaps we could have made a pathe for the wedge to follow as it fell to make sure it fell correctly and popped the balloon. I think I contributed a lot to this project, as I came up with how to put our ideas together and make them work well to create a great machine. I also helped a bit with the building of several complicated aspects in both CAD and cardboard. I am especially proud of the screw I had built and designed. 
                This week, we did two challenges: building the letter E, and creating a floatation device. For building the letter E, I think I did very well. I followed the measurements where I could, and when they didn't add up, I think I interpreted what the designer wanted well enough. For the floatation device, I think I was thinking about it too hard, so I suggested a very complicated design that me and my teammate could not execute very well. I learned from that challenge to keep a more simplistic view and not overcomplicate things when complextiy isn't needed. We learned about computer engineering this week as well. It seems very interesting, but complicated. If I got into it and learned a bit more about the specifics of computer engineering, I would enjoy it quite a lot.

                This week we learned about the different parts of a computer and what they do. We also learned a little bit more about computer engineering. I think the part of computer engineering that interests me the most is embedded systems. I think integrated circuits are quite interesting as well. This week, we took apart a computer to see what was inside and how it was structured. We saw how the parts of a computer was strategically placed so that it would run as fast as possible. For example, RAM was placed very close to the CPU to help it run faster. This weekend, I am not doing much. I will be going to my weekly ice skating lesson on saturday, then doing homework for the rest of the day. Perhaps I will hang out with one of my friends. On Sunday, I will go to church and do praise team there. Then, I will go home and do homework.

            <b>06/10/23</b> - This week we learned about the field of bioengineering. Specifically, we learned about what it is, what other fields it contains within it, and how it can be applied in our lives. I thought the biomimickry portion of bioengineering was pretty cool. In addition, we did a challenge where we had to design a hand out of cardboard, tape, string, and rubber bands. Me and my partner opted for a simpler design when approaching the problem, which was to be able to pick up a water bottle with the prosthetic we were building. In the end, it worked out pretty well, but one thing I wish we had done differently was if we had placed the string differently so it wouldnt obstruct a part of the hand from being used.
            This weekend, I am not really doing anything besides volunteering with ROTC for Oktoberfest and my weekly ice skating lesson. I also have to practice piano for praise team for church this weekend. I am not going to homecoming.

            <i>13/10/23</i> - This week we learned about a new engineering principle: aerospace engineering. Aerospace engineering is about the design and science of things that move in the air (i.e. airplanes, rockets). We learned a little bit about the science of this. For example, the four forces on an object moving through the air are weight, thrust, lift, and drag. There are many things I love about this class, but one of the best things is being able to work with my friends on projects/challenges that interest me.
