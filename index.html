                    So far in this semester, we have done many things both to further our education in this class and to catch up with what we missed last semester with the hacking and wifi outage and whatnot. To start, we finished our last website update for last semester, which was the one about the bridges. 
                    It took a while for me to finish this update because I ran out of storage in my google drive, so I was not able to upload any pictures or videos. Next, we started a unit about chemical engineering. We went over the usual schedule, where we listened and watched Mr. Poole present the slides, 
                    then do a worksheet, activity, and take a quiz related to our unit. For our activity, we made a non-Newtonian fluid, otherwise known as Oobleck, with a group (I was grouped with Jocelyn and Sally). We also started a new project this week, where we are meant to build either a mousetrap car 
                    or an Arduino car. I picked the Arduino car because I am interested in learning Arduino and would like to see what it is capable of. We could not pick our partners for this project, but I am happy with the partner Mr. Poole assigned me (Eron Kim).

                    This week, we started a new project where we make an arduino car. This project is done with a pair, and my partner is Eron Kim. This week, we made a lot of progress. We considered what features we wanted on our car, and decided on a "piano" using a piezo buzzer and some buttons. We started 
                    that by figuring out the wiring in TinkerCad, along with figuring out the wiring for the wheels of our car in real life. Then, we started building the circuit on a breadboard in real life, as it would help us gain a better sense of how the wires and everything was working. We successfully 
                    made the wheels spin, and made two notes on the piano. I think our building and stuff is going pretty smoothly right now, and I'm glad that I am learning a lot through this project. Next week, I hope we can further our project by finishing the code for the wheels and piano, and start 
                    designing the car in TinkerCad.

                    Last week, me and my partner made a lot of progress in both learning how to do things and actually doing them. We were hindered by Eron not being here because he was sick for a few days, but it was ok because he still made decent progress on the piano. I worked a lot on the wheels and using 
                    the IR remote to code the wheels. I learned a lot about the language C+ and especailly how things function in it. I beleive I am very very close to figuring out how to get the codes from the IR remote. That is really the only thing hindering me right now, as I can just make a few simple if 
                    statements when I get the codes for each button on the remote. Other than that, I also made a very very simple CAD of our imagined car. After I finish the remote and Eron finished the piano, we will probably work on actually building the car, and I will CAD a simple seat for "storage" (perhaps).
                    My goals for this week is to finish getting the codes from the remote. A fun fact about my weekend is that I went to a speech tournament for CV's speech and debate team. Things went terribly wrong, both in terms of my performance and with the tournament overall! Tabroom, the website used to 
                    organize and decide rankings went down in the middle of the tournament, and so we didnt get awards or anything from the tournament. It's not like I did particularly good anyhow, but it feels like it was a waste of time.

                    Last week, me and my partner did some stuff. We finished the piano, polished up the CAD for the car, put out the pieces we need to print for the base of the car, figured out the IR remote, started the code for the wheels and almost got it working, and started thinking about other extra things. 
                    Things that we are thinking about/doing that is a bit extra are coding some songs into the piano and assigning them to each button, making a lisence plate for the car, making a storage space for the car, embelishing it with extra visual details and effects, possibly making some lights, and 
                    other interesting things. What we need to finish up or work on this week are the car wheels and assigning each direction to a remote button, actually printing and assembling the physical car, and combining the piano and wheel breadboards. What we probably also need to think about is how ans where 
                    to attatch certain things, such as the IR reciever and the liscence plate.

                    For the past 6 weeks, me and my partner have been working on an Arduino car. Our car was a very good car that performed very well- or at least it would have if the materials were slightly better. I will admit, there are some flaws within the design: a too thick base, no holders for the wheels, 
                    flawed attatchements. However, a lot of the problem was with the battery. We didnt have enough power to make our car move. Otherwise, the car was a beautiful creation that had a wonderfully sleek body made of clear PETG filament, with the breadboard settled beautifully onto a space carved just 
                    for it. The breadboard had a mess of wires that worked all together to not just move the car, but people with its small but powerful piezo buzzer. Because the car is an Arduino car, the limit to what distance it could travel is dependant on its battery. Because of this, I will call the furthest 
                    distance traveled as infinite. We did not make two cars because ours was an Arduino car, but we made many different models of the car. A few differences between some of the beginning designs and the final design was the storage system, the way wheels were attatched, the placement of the breadboard, 
                    and a difference in size. I believe that while our initial designs were wonderful, the final design proved to be the best, especially because that version has all the correct measurements for its real-world counterparts. If we were to make another car, I would like to finish up the piano that plays 
                    from the remote, make the body smaller and lighter, and actually place in the storage system.  I would also like to code a little bit more than I did this time around. Overall, from this project, I have learned so much about the process of thinking about to designing to making and coding a device 
                    that best suits my wants and needs. Some specifics are things like considering the weight of things, learning how the 3D printing process works, figuring out Arduino, and strengthening my wiring skills.

                    Last week, we did two main things- start a new project, and do a challenge for challenge day. The project in question is an egg drop, which is where you have to drop an egg from a certain height - 3 stories in our case - and have it not break or crack. We could not choose our partners for this project, 
                    but I am pretty OK with the partners I ended up with. For our approach to this, our plan is to just cushion the egg as much as possible, an add some rigidity to break the fall. We are making a triangular pyramid type structure immedeatley around the egg, and then shoving into a garbage bagg full of padding. 
                    Around the bag, we are making a cube of popsicle sticks or straws (unknown for now) and attatching two balloons two that. To ensure that the contraption will fall onto the balloons, we have also added cardboard "wings" to let the project stay upright. Hopefully, due to the combination of padding and balloons, 
                    the egg will not break. The thing we are most terrified about is the fact that we have a limited amount of attatchement measures, and so everything might fall apart and not be able to protect the egg. However, the weakest part of the design right now is the balloons, because there is a very high chance of 
                    the contraption not landing on the balloons.

                    For the past two weeks, we have been working on a project called an egg drop. The premise of the project is to drop an egg from up high, and trying to protect it so it does not break. Our approach was to load it with as much cushioning and slow fall as possible, and it worked! When dropping the egg, the 
                    balloons we attatched to the side was met with resistance from the air, and so the whole contraption was slowed. This made the egg reach the ground at a slower velocity, letting it land safer. Additionally, the large amount of cushioning in the form of cotton balls and crumpled up balls of paper absorbed 
                    most of the impact, shieldng the egg. Additionally, if the cushioning did not do enough, we had it so the only contact the egg would make to the ground was through the straw structure surrounding it, allowing for the egg to never take the force of the impact with the ground. Moving on to a different topic, 
                    for spring break, I do not plan to do anything except catch up on schoolwork, play games, sleep, eat (a lot (I am bulking fr)), and go to the gym!

                    For the past two weeks in this class, we have been working on a project called the "Gutter Boat Challenge." This challenge was a chalenge where we had a limited amount of material, most significant being tape. The challenge was to see how far a small boat could go in the shortest time in a narrow, water 
                    filled gutter. Our project went pretty well in my opinion, or better than the majority at least. The method of travel we chose was human/wind powered, and so we built a sail that worked pretty well. Additionally, our aesthetic design was quite appealing in my opinion. Furthermore, we had a great waterproof 
                    ability because of two things- the first being a layer of duct tape to keep water out of the main vessel, and the second was a boat for our boat. The boat boat was to both enure less water got in and to fix a fatal flaw in our design. The fatal flaw in question? The design of the boat itself. It was too 
                    narrow for the boat to be able to stand by itself in the water, so that was why we initially built the boat boat. I think that the boat boat really helped, but in my opinion, I think that we could have done a lot better. For examle, a boat for our boat boat. A boat boat boat if ou will. Or a boat for a boat 
                    boat boat! It would have een wonderful if we had a boat in a boat boat in a boat boat boat in a boat boat boat boat. Anyways, I think this project went pretty well. Regarding this class as a whole, I feel like my faovrite parts of this class was definitley just being able to learn as much as I could. Another 
                    part I liked was the amount of times I could work with my own friends. Additionally, I kind of liked being in groups with other people as well because I got to meet some pretty cool new people. For example, during the egg drop and car projects! However, one of my least favorite parts of this class was when I 
                    got partnered with someone I didn't know, and they didn't pull their own weight in a project. For this weekend, I have to go to a speech and debate tournament on Saturday, which is dull and brain-rotting. However, I also have church and a DND session planned on Sunday, so I am excited about that.

                    This past week, we have been introduced and started working on our final for this semester. The final project is to build a big boat to sail across the vast CVHS pool with two people (Sally and I) on it. I am very excited because of the limited amount of materials we have to bring our boat together. While we 
                    may have an unlimited amount of materials - one roll of duct tape to be specific - that is what excites me about the challenge. We only have a limited amount of materials to get the boat right, so I'm excited about how I can ensure and test the boat works without a few prototypes. I'm also excited to sail the 
                    boat and also to watch other people's boats sink (wishing everyone the best of luck though). Our group has mostly been researching about how to make a boat float and NOT flip over. We have seen methods such as different types of keels, shapes of boats, and the importance of surface area. We have also started 
                    working on the CAD of the boat! We have decided on the dimensions and the shape as well, so I believe we are making pretty good progress. I am looking forward to the FIRST robotics competition we are travelling to for our robotics team THIS WEEK! I hope we have a lot of fun, and maybe fin a few awards????

While I was gone for the past week from Wednesday to Tuesday, my two other group members did good on finishing up the CAD and starting on the boat. While I was gone, they made one piece for the back piece and the side, 
                    but when I came back, we found that it was a little too long, so we cut it down, along with making the two joined pieces used to make each side piece have a stronger bond. When I came back, we made another piece and ran into a roadblock - we couldn't figure out how to make the pointed side that we wanted. 
                    Eventually, Jocelyn and Sally came up with a pretty smart solution. During that time, I was also updating the CAD to make it more accurate. We did the math for how long each piece should be, and so now we are just waiting for more cardboard. I also started on the floor of the upper part of our boat while Jocelyn 
                    and Sally were doing the math stuff. I think the most challenging part of this boat project that we will have to overcome is the lack of cardboard and time, but also just being able to build the boat, as the design is more complicated than others because of the tilted walls and the rounded keel. However, I am very 
                    excited to see the end product of our beautiful creation. On an unrelated note, I am also very excited to finally finish AP exams and not have to worry about them anymore. On a VERY unrelated note, a stereotype that I am commonly placed into is that I am a lot younger than I actually am. This is frustrating, because 
                    strangers tend to take me less seriously than what I am trying to communicate, so I hope to overcome this by bulking up and being taller :(

                    This past week in Engineering we have been constantly slaving away at our boat, trying to get it in tip top shape as fast as possible. Our progress for this week was pretty good, as we have finished making the floor where we shall sit on, started attatching the finished walls of our boat, figured out our walls are not 
                    finished, asked for more cardboard for our unfinished walls, finished the walls for the front triangle part of our boat, and figured out the math for the bottom part of our boat that keeps us balanced. We also looked around and gathered data on some boats and their passengers who have similar boats to ours. This week, 
                    we are planning to finish up the walls of the boat, finish attatching them, and get at least 70% done with the bottom part of the boat. After we finish what we can this coming week, we will see about trying to get weights to help us stay and balance in the boat. We are pretty concerned about the boat not going as far 
                    in the water as we would have liked it to be going, which would mess with our balance and getting across. I'm also concerned about how we'll get across the pool, as we dont have any oars. I believe orange juice is 100% better than apple juice because it is simply better. I throw up when I see apple juice, or apples in 
                    general.

                        Our boat is going well so far. We are working hard to finish it as fast as possible, as well as trying to find a solution to us not being heavy enough to sink the boat as much as we want to. This week we finished attatching the sides to the floor, including the triangle bit at the front. We also reinforced everything, 
                        as the tape kept unsticking. There is a big problem right now of the boat being too big, and so we need to fix that as soon as possible. Because it is too big, we cannot sink as much as we would like, as well as the boat being constantly touched and knocked off of where we place it for the night. We still need to work 
                        on quite a bit of the boat. We need to hurry up and finish up the bottom, as well as possibly making the boat smaller to help with our weight issues. Other than that, we need to make the oars. After that, we will be done with our boat. This weekend for Mothers day, my father, my 2 younger siblings, and I all pitched in 
                        money and went shopping to find presents for my mother. We got her some nail polish, chocolates, roses, and a new frying pan. Additionally, it was my dog's birthday on that same day, so we all celebrated my dog's birthday and mothers day together.

                    Last week we did a lot of things. Mainly, we worked on the bottom half of our boat and did a large surgery to mkae it smaller. While Jocelyn and Sally were working on building the bottom triangle part of the boat, I cut off 14 inches off of the back of the boat. We decided to do this because with our current weight and the 
                    size of the boat, we found that our boat would not sink as much as we would have liked it to. Ideally, our boat would sink 6 inches, but with the previous boat size, we would only sink about 2.5 inches. Now that we succesfully cut and repaired the boat, the boat will sink around 4 inches. This is stil not enough, so we are 
                    planning to put some weights on our boats to make it sink further. For the project Jocelyn and Sally were working on, It is going well, with plenty of supports to both add weight to the boat and also to make sure the bottom does not collapse. We hope this will work well. This week, we need to attatch the bottom and make a 
                    bottom for the triangle part of our boat. Additionally, we need to make oars for our boat, and possibly a keel if we have enough time. This course was very interesting and an enlightening experience for me. I learned a lot, and thought a lot more about my career and life in engineering in the future. I would not really change 
                    anything about this class, I enjoyed pretty much most of it and don't have any complaints about the class itself. During the summer, I am mostly going to be doing summer school for US history. I am also going over to Washington D.C. in the end of June to compete in nationals for AFJROTC JLAB, which is an academic bowl sponsored 
                    by AFJROTC. I am also going to visit family in South Korea in July for around 3 weeks. Finals are also coming up soon, so I should be studying, but I am not. I don't really have any hard finals, as I already had my AP Euro and Physics finals, and the rest of the classes I have are pretty easy.
