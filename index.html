            <b>25/08/23</b> - This is the week I started the Period 7 class "Intro to Engineering". On Thurdsay I joined, and we did a group activity. Our goal was to put a marble in a cup. It was difficult because everyone sucks at communication. Today is Friday. We updated this website on Friday. That is what I did this week.

            <i>01/09/23</i> - This week we learned the engineering principle of CAD, or computer assisted design. In the beginning of the week, we started designing a Rube Goldberg Machine using simple machines. On Thursday, the engineering challenge we did was to design a household appliance on the CAD software TinkerCAD. I did not design anything, as I was selected to be a judge. As a judge, I had to approve reference images, help people with CAD-ing when they needed it, and pick a winner based on design creativity and accuracy.

            <font size="+2">08/09/23</font> - This week, we finalized the design of our Rube Goldberg machine and finished our CAD of it on TinkerCAD. We learned how to make several different simple machines on TinkerCAD, and also how to share a 3D design so we could all work on it together. The goal of our Rube Goldberg machine is to pop a balloon using a needle using several different simple machines. In our design, we are using all 6 of the simple machines. The biggest challenge of this assignment will be finishing assembling everything on time.

                <span style="border:2px dotted #ff8000">15/09/23 and 22/09/23</span> - Last week we started building our Rube Goldberg machine. We worked hard learning how to cut cardboard and revise designs to fit our vision of what our machine would be able to do. While our machine wasn't able to pop the balloon like we wanted, it was only the wedge that didnt work well, and the rest did wonderfully. Perhaps we could have made a pathe for the wedge to follow as it fell to make sure it fell correctly and popped the balloon. I think I contributed a lot to this project, as I came up with how to put our ideas together and make them work well to create a great machine. I also helped a bit with the building of several complicated aspects in both CAD and cardboard. I am especially proud of the screw I had built and designed. 
                This week, we did two challenges: building the letter E, and creating a floatation device. For building the letter E, I think I did very well. I followed the measurements where I could, and when they didn't add up, I think I interpreted what the designer wanted well enough. For the floatation device, I think I was thinking about it too hard, so I suggested a very complicated design that me and my teammate could not execute very well. I learned from that challenge to keep a more simplistic view and not overcomplicate things when complextiy isn't needed. We learned about computer engineering this week as well. It seems very interesting, but complicated. If I got into it and learned a bit more about the specifics of computer engineering, I would enjoy it quite a lot.
