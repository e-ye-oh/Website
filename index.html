            <b>25/08/23</b> - This is the week I started the Period 7 class "Intro to Engineering". On Thurdsay I joined, and we did a group activity. Our goal was to put a marble in a cup. It was difficult because everyone sucks at communication. Today is Friday. We updated this website on Friday. That is what I did this week.

            <i>01/09/23</i> - This week we learned the engineering principle of CAD, or computer assisted design. In the beginning of the week, we started designing a Rube Goldberg Machine using simple machines. On Thursday, the engineering challenge we did was to design a household appliance on the CAD software TinkerCAD. I did not design anything, as I was selected to be a judge. As a judge, I had to approve reference images, help people with CAD-ing when they needed it, and pick a winner based on design creativity and accuracy.
