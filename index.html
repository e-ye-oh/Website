            <font size="+3.5">20/10/23 -</font> This week, we learned more about aerospace engineering. I learned many things about what makes aircraft and spacecraft good at flying through observation and reading about it on various websites. We also built a bottle rocket out of a 2 liter soda bottle, cardboard, paper, duct tape, scotch tape, and hot glue. To fuel it, we put water in the rocket and pressurized it. The shape of the fins were what I focused the most on to make it fly. I tried to create the most aerodynamic shape while being able to generate lift at the same time. When we finally flew the rockets, our rocket flew pretty far. I don't think I had many expectations for it, but I'm glad it did well.
