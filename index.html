            <b>25/08/23</b> - This is the week I started the Period 7 class "Intro to Engineering". On Thurdsay I joined, and we did a group activity. Our goal was to put a marble in a cup. It was difficult because everyone sucks at communication. Today is Friday. We updated this website on Friday. That is what I did this week.

            <i>01/09/23</i> - This week we learned the engineering principle of CAD, or computer assisted design. In the beginning of the week, we started designing a Rube Goldberg Machine using simple machines. On Thursday, the engineering challenge we did was to design a household appliance on the CAD software TinkerCAD. I did not design anything, as I was selected to be a judge. As a judge, I had to approve reference images, help people with CAD-ing when they needed it, and pick a winner based on design creativity and accuracy.

            <font size="+2">08/09/23</font> - This week, we finalized the design of our Rube Goldberg machine and finished our CAD of it on TinkerCAD. We learned how to make several different simple machines on TinkerCAD, and also how to share a 3D design so we could all work on it together. The goal of our Rube Goldberg machine is to pop a balloon using a needle using several different simple machines. In our design, we are using all 6 of the simple machines. The biggest challenge of this assignment will be finishing assembling everything on time.
